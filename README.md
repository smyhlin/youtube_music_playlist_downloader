## Config
- **First of all** rename .env_temp to .env and set parms you need
- A `.playlist_config.json` file is generated for all album folders and contains the following adjustable fields.


### Options adjustable using the program
- `url`: The URL of the playlist to download songs from (default: set during download)
- `reverse_playlist`: Whether to reverse the order of songs in the playlist when downloading (default: `false`)

- `use_uploader`: Whether to use the uploader or the artist name provided by YouTube where possible as the artist for downloaded songs (default: `true`)
- `use_playlist_name`: Whether to use the playlist or the album name provided by YouTube where possible as the album for downloaded songs (default: `true`)


### Additional options adjustable through the config file
- `sync_folder_name`: Whether to automatically sync the name of the playlist folder to the YouTube playlist name (default: `true`)
- `use_threading`: Whether to use threading for faster song downloading and updating at the cost of more CPU and memory usage (default: `true`)
- `thread_count`: Number of threads to use for threading - if set to 0, this value will be dynamically determined (default: `0`)
- `retain_missing_order`: Whether to retain the current order of missing or deleted songs if a local copy exists or move them to the end of the album (default: `false`)
- `name_format`: The name format used to generate file names in yt-dlp output template format (default: `"%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s"`)
- `track_num_in_name`: Whether to include the track number at the start of all file names (default: `true`)
- `audio_format`: The audio format used by yt-dlp when downloading songs (default: `"bestaudio/best"`)

    - Language codes support regex and are matched to the full string, for example: `"en.*"` is interpreted as `"^en.*$"` before regex matching
    - Example: `["en.*", "ja"]` means select the first language with prefix `en`, else select the language that exactly matches `ja` if it exists
